# Big-Number-Calculate
This program is written by C, and IDE is CLion.
## Origin
The main function of this program is to calcalate big numbers.<br>
As we know, if the number is bigger than 2<sup>64</sup>-1 (It's about 20 digits), if we want to calculate the number with 30 digits? Don't tell me to use double type, it has errors in C... So I want to make a program that can calcaulte big numbers, and this program was born.

## Function
As the name suggests, this program can **add**, **subtract** ,and **multiply** the numbers with max to 10000 digits. It can also calculate *negative* numbers.
